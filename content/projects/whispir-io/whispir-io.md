The website developed for [whispir.io](https://whispir.io/) was the first major website project at Whispir. Overall a really fast (1.5 weeks) and fun project to turn around. The website itself is based of a bootstrap core that sits on top of a PHP backed. As a result its really quite easy to extend.

Some other libraries used in the development:

- [wow.js](wow.js)
- [animate.css](animate.css)
- [Bootstrap Validator](http://1000hz.github.io/bootstrap-validator/)
