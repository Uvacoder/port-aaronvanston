Farmclicker is an idle clicker game based on gathering/selling resources. This style of games resembles the likes of [Cookie clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) or [Clicking bad](http://clickingbad.nullism.com/).

This project uses `react` + `redux` for the view and state management.

## Motivation around the game

I wanted to build a complex version of the tradition idle clicker game. Involving multiple resources (eggs, milk, wheat etc) that can work together and combine to produce complex items to sell. Eventually with enough items, a small industry could be formed producing and selling a variety of produce.
